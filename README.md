My awesome tailwind templates.

# ⚠️ Caution

This repository only for demonstration. If you want to use tailwind please use with **[purge](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#writing-purgeable-html)** option. Default tailwind.min.css comes with about ~2MB and this is not best practise. You can reduce template **[sizes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production)**.
